## Context
Nothing too special. Just openned sublime text and remembered about a challenge made from udacity's instructors.
The challenge was to develop an app just to count clicks using MVC architectural pattern. 
The controller is called octopus like the instructors suggested.

## Future steps
Maybe I'll create a little game with this idea. Who knows what's the future is preparing.
